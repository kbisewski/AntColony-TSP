# AntColony-TSP
Ant colony optimisation algorithm is used for solving travelling salesman problem in example.
Ants spread pheromone while walking, but pheromone evaporates. 
Ant chooses the random way, but the more pheromone it sense, the greater probability that it will go there.
Pheromone accumulates on the shortest ways.
I've implemented this algorithm in app above.

When application started, you need to pick at least four points on the field and choose type of alghorithm and click Start.
